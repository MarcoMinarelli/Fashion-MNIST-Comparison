## Fashion-MNIST-Comparison
This project is born as an assignment for the Artificial Intelligence exam at University of Florence.

# Target
The objective of this assignment is to compare the results of Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random forest machine learning algorithms.
The dataset used is the Fashion MNIST (available [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) ).

# Libraries used
Two libraries are necessary to reproduce the results of the experiments: 
 * Numpy: required for effective vectors and matrices use. 
 * Scikit-Learn: provides the implementation of the algorithms.
 
# How to reproduce the results of the experiments
To reproduce the experiment's results, the dataset has to be downloaded and put in the "data" directory.
